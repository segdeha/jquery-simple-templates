= Introduction =

Simple Templates is a jQuery plug-in that provides an easy way to merge content within JavaScript. It is designed to work much like the built-in Template class in [http://prototypejs.org/ Prototype].

= Installation =

  # Download the plug-in
  # Link to the plug-in script from within your HTML (be sure it comes *after* your link to the jQuery library)
  # Start using Simple Templates in your code!

=Usage=

{{{
$('#my-div').html($.tmpl('<div class="#{my-class}">#{my-content}</div>', {'my-class': 'blue-headers', 'my-content': 'This is what I have to say!'}));
}}}

Simple Templates works by searching your template string (the first parameter passed into `$.tmpl`) for tokens of the format `#{some-identifier}` and replacing them with corresponding keys from the values object (the second parameter).

Here's another example:

{{{
var myTemplate = "Hello #{name}. I hear you're feeling #{emotion}.";
var myValues = {
   name : 'Joey Joe Joe',
   emotion : 'like singing'
};
var myResult = $.tmpl(myTemplate, myValues);
}}}

`myResult` now holds the string: `Hello Joey Joe Joe. I hear you're feeling like singing.`

This little plugin ain't rocket science. Heck, it ain't even computer science. But, it filled a need for me and I hope you find it useful, too. Enjoy!
